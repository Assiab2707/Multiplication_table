This report is made by the tasks assigned to each member of the group: Goujili Nouhaila, Berrandou Assia, Sobolak Val√©rian et Sene Assane. The element of our project studies the modular beauty of multiplication tables; in particular the geometric representation of multiplication tables in modular arithmetic.

We decide that the assignment of tasks will take the following way:

1. The  code that generates different simple math questions as the modulo(The class of graph): by all the group'members. 

2. For The first visualization: There will be three sub-tasks:

<ul>
<li>Display the circle, dots functions for the base in function the modulo by Valerian Sobolak </li>
<li>Display of edges in function of the modulo and the number of multiplication table by: Assia Berrandou </li>
<li>Creation of the graphic user interface by: Nouhaila Goujili</li>
</ul>


3. The aspects of the graphical visualization, as ,  the colors and design; by: **Assane Sene**

4. The animation of the visualization, by: **Assia Berrandou** and **Nouhaila Goujili**

5. **Assane Sene**  and **Valerian Sobolak**will take care of the documentation. 

6. Tests will be realized by **Assia Berrandou** and **Nouhaila Goujili**. 

The assignment of tasks can be modified for the members of the group. 
 


Once it's all over we'll do the referendum or what is called by the benchmarking.
