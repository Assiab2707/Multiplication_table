This report is made by the tasks assigned to each member of the group: Goujili Nouhaila, Berrandou Assia, Sobolak Val√©rian et Sene Assane. The element of our project studies the modular beauty of multiplication tables; in particular the geometric representation of multiplication tables in modular arithmetic.

We decide that the assignment of tasks will take the following way:

 1. The  code that generates different simple math questions as the modulo, that is, the rest of the entire division that manages the periodic character; the trigonometric circle and angles, and finally the change of the landmark. 
 2. The 2D visualization and also the graphical interface, widgets and tracking in a canvas. 
 4. Tests 

 
When we complete all that; we'll make the documentation using Sphinx and finish the README.md file.

Once it's all over we'll do the referendum or what is called or what is called by the benchmarking.
