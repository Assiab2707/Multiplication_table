This report describes the tasks assigned to each group member: Goujili Nouhaila, Berrandou Assia, Sobolak Valérian et Sene Assane. Our project studies the modular beauty of multiplication tables; in particular the geometric representation of multiplication tables in modular arithmetic.

We decide that the assignment of tasks would take the following way:

1. The code that generates different simple math questions as the modulo(The class of graph): by all the group members.

2. For the first visualization, there would be three sub-tasks:

<ul>
<li>Display the circle, dots functions for the base in function the modulo by Valerian Sobolak </li>
<li>Display of edges in function of the modulo and the number of multiplication table by: Assia Berrandou </li>
<li>Creation of the graphic user interface by: Nouhaila Goujili</li>
</ul>


3. The aspects of the graphical visualization, as ,  the colors and design; by: **Assia Berrandou** & **Nouhaila Goujili** and **Valérian Sobolak**. 

4. The animation of the visualization, by: **Assia Berrandou** and **Nouhaila Goujili**.

5.  The documentation is made by **all members of the group**: 
 <ul>
 <li> **Valérian Sobolak**  generated the `base_vis`' documentation </li>
 <li> **Assia Berrandou** generated the `Class graph` and some functions of the `Interface_gestion` documentation </li>
 <li> **Assane Sene** generated the `edges_vis`' documentation </li>
 <li> **Goujili Nouhaila** generated some functions of `Interface_gestion` documentation </li>
 </ul>


6. Tests realized by **Assia Berrandou** and **Valérian Sobolak**. 

7. Continuous integration was made by **Valérian Sobolak**. 


After all of this, we made the beamer and the video of our group representation.
